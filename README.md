# Hand-Cricket-Simulation
This code creates a full-screen Hand Cricket game using Python’s Tkinter, featuring toss, overs selection, two-innings gameplay, scoring, commentary, and keyboard/button input. It also includes canvas-based animations (ball, players, moving crowd) and manages the complete match flow from start to reset with a graphical interface.
